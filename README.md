# Unity-Tag-Manager
A replacement for Unity's tag system

##About

Unity's Tag system isn't the best, for a couple of reasons: 
1. The editor must be restarted after deleting a tag (as of 5.5)
2. You can't have multiple tags
3. The UI in the editor isn't easy to use. 

This is a replacement to all of that. It involves making a library asset with all of your tags, then adding the tags you want to a gameobject.
